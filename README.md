**About**
---
The Roblox Replayable Escape Room is a 3D puzzle-based game built in Roblox Studio. Players must solve puzzles, interact with objects, and use hints from an AI character to escape. Each playthrough is different — puzzles, item locations, and story outcomes are randomized to keep the game fresh. The game aims to combine challenge, storytelling, and atmosphere (including audio cues and horror elements) for a fun, replayable experience.
